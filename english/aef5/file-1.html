    <h2>Listening 1</h2>
    <h3>Speaker 1</h3>
    <div class="example">
        I would hate to be a salesman of any kind, the idea terrifies me. <br>
        I think a lot of your time is spent pressurizing people, lying to them, potentially, I am not saying all
        salesmen do this, <br>
        but I think a lot of the time you do have to sell things that you don’t necessarily believe in. I don’t like
        that as a concept. <br>
        A few of my friends, my school friends, they’re salesmen, they love it, they’ve got the gift of the gab, they
        can, you know, talk the hind legs off a donkey, but, just, there is a feeling I get that is a little bit
        unsavoury at times, <br>
        I know, this is a huge sweeping generalization, but I just wouldn't like to
        do it
    </div>
    <h3>Speaker 2</h3>
    <div class="example">
        The job I would hate to do is probably a bit obvious,
        but I don’t think I’d like to be a bin man, because
        I think that, well, it would obviously smell a lot and
        also – I don’t agree with it – but I think that there is
        possibly, maybe a bit of stigma attached to the job
        and people, <br>I don’t know, might look down at you
        even though I don’t agree with that. <br>I do know some
        guys who are bin men and they are fabulous and
        they have an amazing camaraderie with each other,
        they actually really enjoy their job and they finish
        fairly early, they work pretty good hours, <br>and they
        are not stuck in an office every day, so they are out
        and about. I’ve never been a bin man, but when
        I worked in a bar I had to go round picking up
        cigarette butts off the floor and picking up
        everyone’s rubbish, <br>and sort of clearing up after
        people, I didn’t mind it, but it’s not that pleasant.
    </div>
    <h3>Speaker 3</h3>
    <div class="example">
        I think a job I’d really like to do is be a professional
        actor. It must be great just going to, <br>going filming
        in exotic locations and appearing on the West End
        stage. I used to be in school plays when I was a kid,<br>
        so I think I’ve got what it takes. My brother-in-law
        used to be an extra in TV films and TV
        programmes like East Enders, so he told me all
        about it – what goes on and that. <br>I can’t really think
        of any downsides in this job – maybe the fact that
        you are unemployed a lot, <br>maybe that’s a bit of a
        downside, but other than that I think it would be
        great.
    </div>
    <h3>Speaker 4</h3>
    <div class="example">
        Well, I would love to be a midwife. I think it would
        be a wonderful thing to do, I think it would be
        rewarding, challenging and I would love to do it.<br>
        My friend Annie is a midwife, she’s an independent
        midwife and loves it. <br>And I think the drawbacks to
        it, for her, are that, of course, you are on call all the
        time and you can be in the middle of a film and
        suddenly get a bleep on your phone but you have to
        go and deliver a baby, so you couldn’t really, <br>you
        know, plan your life around anything other than
        that. And I suppose one of the reasons I think
        I might be good at it is that, <br>having had two
        children myself, I do have first-hand experience of
        the kind of things that you would need, and I think
        I’ve got an understanding of what, you know, a
        woman might, <br>might need to know and the
        encouragement you might need when you’re in
        labour.
    </div>
    <h3>Speaker 5</h3>
    <div class="example">
        A job I would absolutely hate would be to work in a
        call centre. I think it would be one of the worst jobs
        in the world because you are in the middle,
        <br>I think
        you get a terrible time from both sides,
        <br>from the
        people who are your bosses and from the people
        who call the call centre who are usually cross about
        something and have a problem.
        <br> I did telesales once
        a long time ago, part-time, so that was a slight
        experience of it and I hated it and never want to do
        it again and <br>
        I think the only positive side to the job
        that I can see is that it is a job and you get paid
